CodeWars
Sign up with your Chaparral email account for a Github so you can make changes.
This will be for the 2015 CSA CodeWars team
You are welcome to post any code you want here, just keep it school appropriate of course.
Code will be placed here, along with help for those in need
I will be updating rules, and posting guidelines, etc. but for right now use common sense.
